      <h1 class="abouth1">A Glimpse into my Life</h1>
      <li>Graduated from the University of Washington (Seattle) in 2015 with a degree in Electrical Engineering</li>
      <li>Completed a rotational engineering program with Leviton Manufacturing Co, focusing on product design and leadership development.
          This program took me across the country, from Seattle to New York City</li>
      <li>I am an avid sports fan: Mariners, Huskies, and Seahawks (in that order)</li>
      <li>As I advance in my career I have become more and more fascinated by software development and design.  Building off my classwork as an undergrad,
          I am learning as much as I can outside of a classroom, applying coding to my work, as well as personal projects!</li>
